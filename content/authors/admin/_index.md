Hi my name is Stephen, I am a recent graduate from the Neuroimaging and Informatics program at the University of Southern California. I previously studied Psychology at the California State University of Fullerton, with a fervent interest in conducting research, specifically in cognitive neuropsychology. Currently, I am working as a research assistant in a Neuroimaging Lab at the California Institute of Technology. My primary research goals involve researching the neurological development of learning disabilities. I am interested in using MRI to search for neurological markers of learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorder. I am also interested in using MRI to studying cognition, PTSD, generalized anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.
